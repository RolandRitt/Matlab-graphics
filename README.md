This repository collects functions used to generate high quality figures to support high quality plots for publications.

This toolbox is also mirrored to the [Matlab File Exchange](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/3965795-roland).
It is heavily used in the [mdtsToolbox](https://github.com/RolandRitt/Matlab-mdtsToolbox).
